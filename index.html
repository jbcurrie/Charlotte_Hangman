		<!--You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

		Guess what letter I'm thinking of

		Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

		Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

		Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

		Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

		When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

		When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

		Pseudocode: 
		theme: charlotte neighborhoods (89 total neighborhoods)
			screen shows region picture
			screen shows hint
			20 neighborhoods per game
			function randomly selects a word from array
			screen shows "_ _ _" corresponding to the randomly selected neighborhood
			event key key records key pressed
			if key matches a letter in the randomly selected word, then show letter
			repeat if letter is in word multiple times
			user gets 20 guesses (increment down if wrong guess)
			if right, noise sounds off, increase wins counter and start game again
			next word appears, reset guess counter
			if wrong, increase losses counter and restart the game without page refresh
			at 20 games, bigger noise sounds if win. if loss, ask to try again. 

		wordbank with letters
		correct guess find letter and remove from array?

		a win, you guess the word before all of chances are used up
		a loss, you don't guess the word before all of you chances. 

		1. use key events to listen for the letters your players will type
			set a event key to listen for key strokes
			log the key strokes to an array
			display the array

		2. create an array of objects for the neighborhoods. Display the objects using a function. if you type all letters of the word array, you the function completes and the next word appears. 

		or

		2. create an array of objects for the neighborhoods. create a function to replace "_" for each letter in the word array. Display the "_" along with the remaining property values in the object. 
		i'm supposed to create an array of objects.
			what if i use the object constructor function to build all objects? would that allow me to reference all objects using a single variable? the single variable could run through a for loop to randomly select one object from the array and display it.

			add a new property to the object that replaces "_" for the total length of the neighborhood property. this.changeLetters = function (neighborhood) {
	 			//run a function to replace word with total length of neighborhood array. 
			}

			all objects are stored under an array called newWord  
			
			you can call upon a function and have it run when peforming document getElementByID (so if you create a function to replace words with dashes, you can store it until the word is displayed)
